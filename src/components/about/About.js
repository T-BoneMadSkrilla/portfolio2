                    I graduated in 2015 from Sam Houston State University with a degree in geography and a certificate in GIS. I thoroughly enjoyed taking large sets of data and making sense of it with maps. 
                    <br></br>
                    Their weren't many jobs in GIS when I graduated but I was lucky enough to land my first real job in business development at a small software company. I loved having a difficult job but it wasn't long before I realized my creative/technical bug was unfullied and that's when I started to dabble with coding.

                     My development journey started in 2016 when I started learning HTML and CSS through online courses after work. I wasn't very good at first but I enjoyed spending time learning and turning thoughts into tangible things.  Knowing a little code also helped since, at the time, I was working in sales for Vista software companies.

                    In early 2018, I started an eCommerce company with Shopify. Unfortunately, sales dried up and my marketing budget was nearly zero. It was an incredible learning experience; I learned that I really enjoyed building sites and I was curious about the code behind all the cool things I could do with Shopify and WordPress. That's when I started learning what has turned into my love language, JavaScript.

                <div className="secondParagraph">
                   It took me a few months but I decided to go to a coding bootcamp to sharpen my skills. After a lot of early mornings and late nights, I graduated from DevMountain in December 2018.
